# Django-and-ML
Online classification of disease using ML

This is a basic Python Web Application made using the Django Framework.

The Application takes a picture of x-ray and classifies it into one of the two followings, Pneumonia or Normal, then shows the result.

The, "Django_app_files", folder contains the necessary files for the application (It does not contain all the files and folders that Django generates 
during the initiation of a project, only the ones modified or made specifically for this application).

The, "Pneumonia_detector_model_NN", folder contains the files to generate a neural network model. The model is not uploaded
here as it takes up a lot of space.

With the Application structure used here, any Machine Learning model (with the necessary adjustments and codes for 
uploaded image modifications required for that Machine Learning model) can be used to develop a Web Application that classifies images.

**Points to be noted**:
1. The codes used here to generate a model generates a very simple Machine Learning model that occupies a small space. 
Not Recommended for practical applications.
